<p>I was born in Proserpine, near Airlie Beach up north, in an english speaking household but our family moved down to Brisbane <br>
  when I was around 3.  A interesting fact about me is I have both been homeless for several years in the past, as well as the <br>

  start a web company with a friend.</p>

<p>Photoshop, Chess, Walking my dog, researching latest science, and cooking.</p>
<h3><b>IT Interests:</b></h3>
<p>I started getting interested in computers after being given an Amiga 500 for mowing one of my mums friend's lawns a few times and <br>
  it came with about 500 games on giant floppy discs.  It was games originally that got me interested, but s I became a teenager I <br>
  was most impressed with discussion boards, internet relay chat and the potential for the internet to connect me with like minded <br>
  indiviuals all over the world.  I became obsessed with computers around 13-13 years of age.</p>
<h3><b>IT Experience:</b></h3>
<p>I did IT in years 11 & 12 and then started a Bachelor of IT at Griffith university in Brisbane.  I did half of this degree but <br>
  left to start an internet company.  I stopped using computers again till I was mid 20s and have had an active interest in them <br>
  since.  I have worked on several database driven websites but feel I have quite a basic knowledge of website design.</p>

      As an Indie Games Developer Karl spends his day adapting code, mainly working on developing the save function for his <br>
      city-builder, adding additional functions to the behaviour trees of NPCs, so that activities performed have multiple <br>
      actions and aligning these actions with a status of Running, Passed or Failed, and a Boolean value of either True, for <br>
      both Passed and Failed, or False for Running.  He spent the afternoon working on a new developer tool to import mesh <br>
      information regarding points of interest (nodes and how these nodes are connected) from a 3D model, and then converts the <br>
      information to a format suitable Entities document, which is then viewed in Notepad++.  To do this he opens the 3d model <br>
      in Blender and then applies a mesh showing how all nodes are connected, and then exports the information into a Wavefront <br>
      (.obj) file, and then created a new Java file that imports the .obj file and then extracts the necessary mesh data, converts <br>
      the data so the Entities file can read it, and the exports the data to the clipboard, so it can be copied and pasted  into <br>
      the Entities file.</li>
    <li>What kinds of people do they interact with?
      Other IT professionals, Clients, Investors, or the general public

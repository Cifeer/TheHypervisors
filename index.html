  •	What kind of work does the IT professional perform?
  As an Indie Games Developer Karl spends his day adapting code, mainly working on developing the save function for his city-builder, adding additional functions to the behaviour trees of NPCs, so that activities performed have multiple actions and aligning these actions with a status of Running, Passed or Failed, and a Boolean value of either True, for both Passed and Failed, or False for Running.  He spent the afternoon working on a new developer tool to import mesh information regarding points of interest (nodes and how these nodes are connected) from a 3D model, and then converts the information to a format suitable Entities document, which is then viewed in Notepad++.  To do this he opens the 3d model in Blender and then applies a mesh showing how all nodes are connected, and then exports the information into a Wavefront (.obj) file, and then created a new Java file that imports the .obj file and then extracts the necessary mesh data, converts the data so the Entities file can read it, and the exports the data to the clipboard, so it can be copied and pasted into the Entities file.

<h3><b>Background:</b></h3>
<p>I was born in Proserpine, near Airlie Beach up north, in an english speaking household but our family moved down to Brisbane when I was around 3.  A interesting fact about me is I have both been <br>
  homeless for several years in the past, as well as the CEO of an web company.  I did half of an IT degree @ Griffith University in Brisbane when I finished school, but left early to start a web <br>
  company with a friend.</p>
<h3><b>Hobbies:</b></h3>
<p>Photoshop, Chess, Walking my dog, researching latest science, and cooking.</p>
<h3><b>IT Interests:</b></h3>
<p>I started getting interested in computers after being given an Amiga 500 for mowing one of my mums friend's lawns a few times and it came with about 500 games on giant floppy discs.  It was games <br>
  originally that got me interested, but s I became a teenager I <br>
  was most impressed with discussion boards, internet relay chat and the potential for the internet to connect me with like minded indiviuals all over the world.  I became obsessed with computers <br>
  around 13-13 years of age.</p>
<h3><b>IT Experience:</b></h3>
<p>I did IT in years 11 & 12 and then started a Bachelor of IT at Griffith university in Brisbane.  I did half of this degree but left to start an internet company.  I stopped using computers again <br>
  till I was mid 20s and have had an active interest in them since.  I have worked on several database driven websites but feel I have quite a basic knowledge of website design.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What kind of work does the IT professional perform?
      As an Indie Games Developer Karl spends his day adapting code, mainly working on developing the save function for his <br>
      city-builder, adding additional functions to the behaviour trees of NPCs, so that activities performed have multiple <br>
      actions and aligning these actions with a status of Running, Passed or Failed, and a Boolean value of either True, for <br>
      both Passed and Failed, or False for Running.  He spent the afternoon working on a new developer tool to import mesh <br>
      information regarding points of interest (nodes and how these nodes are connected) from a 3D model, and then converts the <br>
      information to a format suitable Entities document, which is then viewed in Notepad++.  To do this he opens the 3d model <br>
      in Blender and then applies a mesh showing how all nodes are connected, and then exports the information into a Wavefront <br>
      (.obj) file, and then created a new Java file that imports the .obj file and then extracts the necessary mesh data, converts <br>
      the data so the Entities file can read it, and the exports the data to the clipboard, so it can be copied and pasted  into <br>
      the Entities file.</li>
    <li>What kinds of people do they interact with?
      Other IT professionals, Clients, Investors, or the general public
    Karl responds to emails and comments left on his YouTube videos from the general public.</li>
    <li>Where do they spend most of their time?

  <h1><b>IT Technologies</b></h1>

<br>
  <h1><b>Project Idea</b></h1>
  <b>Overview</b> <p>This should be a summary of what the project will be.
  This project will focus on the development of a game, and will look at the hardware and software requirements, as well as the skills needed <br>
  to be able to design the game.  This project will be designed to be run on the Windows, Android, and Apple iOS platforms.</p><br>

  <b>Motivation</b>
  <p>The game that I will be designing is based upon Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), such as World of Warcraft, and <br>
    it will address the limitations of typical MMORPGs.  I will be looking at reducing the time commitment needed to play these games, and the <br>
    need to actively group with other to pursue dungeons or raid dungeons (needing 10+ players).  The system used will be to allow players to <br>
    ecruit friends and Guild members to join them in dungeons and raid dungeons.  The active player will then be able to control the team members <br>
    skills by selecting what skill that they need the character to use.</p>

  <b>Description</b>
  <p>The MMORPG to be designed in 8-bit graphics and will be in 2-dimensions.  This game will draw on elements from early Role-Playing Games like <br>
    Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger or Suikoden.  It will draw on graphical elements from games like Chrono Trigger for the world overview, as <br>
    well as for level design.  The gameplay draws inspiration from the turn-based fighting style of games like Final Fantasy or Suikoden, where <br>
    the characters take actions when their Action Bar maxes out.  Characters have the typical attributes of an RPG, these being Strength, Intellect, <br>
    Spirit, Agility, Vitality, and Defence.  The particular attributes chosen will depend upon what role the player wishes their character to hold, <br>
    for instance a tank would need high Vitality and Defence attributes, whereas a Mage or Healer would need high Intellect and Spirit, a Melee Damage <br>
    character would require high Strength and Agility and may choose to put some points into Vitality for survivability.
    <ol>
      <li>Strength: which determines Physical Damage;</li>
      <li>Intellect: which determines Magic Damage, and Healing Amount;</li>
      <li>Spirit: which determines Magic Regen;</li>
      <li>Agility: which determines Critical Chance, Dodge Chance, as well as how quickly the Action Bar refills;</li>
      <li>Vitality: which determines how much Health a character has; and</li>
      <li>Defence: which determines how much damage a character can take.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Characters earn experience from fights, as well as from completing quests, and when a character earns enough experience, they level up and earn a <br>
    set number of points that they can place in any of the six attributes.  Players can earn weapons, armour, and other items, such as health and mana <br>
    potions from doing quests or from defeating bosses in dungeons and raid dungeons.  Weapons and armour give a set number of attribute points and a <br>
    skill, for example a Shield dropped from a dungeon boss would have a value of x number of Vitality or Defence points, and a skill that will reduce <br>
    incoming damage by a value of x, whereas a Staff would have a value of x number of Intelligence or Spirit points, and a skill aimed at either dealing <br>
    a value of x number of Magic Damage or Healing a value of x number of health points.  Players will have access to a store where they can purchase health <br>
    or mana potions, as well as experience boosters, and loot drop rate boosters so that they can minimise their time spent on the game.  Players can also <br>
    join Guilds, and as the players kill bosses in dungeons and raid dungeons, they earn experience for their Guild.  As the Guild levels up they will be <br>
    able to purchase items from the Guild Store which increase experience earned or drop rate for items.</p><br>

  <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
  <p>There are a multitude of software options available for games design, the most popular being GameMaker Studio 2, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4.  The <br>
  ecommended hardware for GameMaker Studio 2 is 64-bit OS, either Windows 10 or macOS Catalina, a Quad Core CPU, 8GB RAM, a dedicated graphics card, <br>
  an SSD with 3GB free disk space, and an internet connection (YoYo Games 2021).  Additional Software Development Kits (SDK) are required Mac Integrated <br>
  Development Environment (IDE), namely Mono 6, Xcode, and Steamworks SDK 1.42 is required for Steam builds for both Mac and Windows IDEs (YoYo Games 2021).  <br>
  The recommended hardware for Unity is 64 bit OS, either Windows 7 (SP1+) and Windows 10 or High Sierra 10.13+, a CPU with X64 architecture with SSE2 <br>
  instruction set support, and a graphic card capable of DX10, DX11, and DX12-capable GPUs (Unity Technologies 2021).  The recommended hardware for Unreal <br>
  Engine 4 is Windows 10 64-bit, Quad-core 2.5 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM, and a DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 compatible graphics card (Epic Games 2021).</p><br>

  <b>Skills Required</b>
  Knowledge of programming languages is a necessity to be able to design a game.  Each of the three main game development software programs uses a different language: GameMaker Studio 2 uses its own proprietary language, GameMaker Language (YoYo Games 2021); Unity requires knowledge of C# (Unity Technologies 2021); <br>
  and Unreal Engine 4 requires knowledge of C++ (Epic Games 2021).  The ability to draw is an essential skill, as it is required to create the games assets, including User Interface, characters, enemies, .items, and scenery.  Problem solving skills and the capability to think logically are essential when designing <br>
  levels, systems, artificial intelligence, combat, economy, and quests, as well as when keeping the game balanced (O’Connor, 2020).  Some musical knowledge is needed to design the musical score.

  <b>Outcome</b>
  This game will help to fill a hole in the market and allow players to be able to cooperate with other players to run dungeons and raid dungeons, without having to spend between two to six hours at their computer.  This game will allow players with time constraints to get all the benefits of playing an MMORPG without the hassle of trying to organise dungeon groups, or raid dungeon groups, and also eliminates the hassle of dealing with player who steal loot dropped by dungeon and raid dungeon bosses.

  Finances
  <b>Funding</b>
  I will be starting off the project by myself, creating all the code and the game assets to get a proof-of-concept idea working, or to the Alpha phase of testing.  After I reach Alpha phase I may look at see if I can get backers to finance the project either via either crowdsourcing the funds or by seeing if I can get some investors to fund the project.  Auroch Digital (2021) suggest that for an indie game the projected range of cost for a project is between $50,000 to $750,000, so a typical indie games developer with 5 staff and a 2 year development time would be seeing a development cost of between $250,000 and $500,000, and an extra $250,000 for advertising costs.

  <b>Revenue</b>
  This game will make it money by getting users to watch in-game advertising for rewards, such as extra dungeon tokens, or item drop-rate boosters.  In-game ad revenue for rewarded video ads, is $0.02 per impression and generate between $10 to $50 per 1000 ad impressions or effective cost per mille (eCPM) (IronSource n.d.).  Game developers can also utilise interstitial, which are full-screen advertisements played during loading screens, and these pay $0.16 per completion and generate between $10 to $20 eCPM for tier 1 countries (IronSource n.d.).  There is also another means to earn revenue via in-game advertising, and that is via the use of an offerwall, which acts as a mini-store inside the programs which can take users to various offers and rewards users for meeting certain criteria, and offerwalls can generate up to $940 eCPM (IronSource n.d.).  The game will also include an in-game store where users can purchase items, such as equipment, item drop-rate boosters and other expendable resources for real money.

  Scope of Project
  <b>Time Frame</b>
  I will be mainly working by myself in the beginning, so I expect it will take one year, just to see some sort of progress, and two to three years just to get to playable state, Alpha phase, maybe Beta phase.  I will be looking to slowly build up the game, introducing just the core features, such as enemy AI, bosses, weapon, armour, and accessory loot drops, and then expanding to include new areas which will bring out new bosses and new loot drops.  The expansion patches for the game will likely take 6 months to 1 year to complete.

  Atavism offers a variety features that that would reduce the development time significantly.  These features include:
  •	Plugins –
  o	Database (setups up and edit database information);

  o	User Account Management (sets admin privileges, and ban player) and;
  o	Server Authoritative (sets actions that reduce bandwidth) (Atavism 2021).

  <b>Scalability</b>
  As a game reaches the market and becomes popular, there will be a need to increase the number of Concurrent Users (CCU).  Atavism offers Games Developers that utilise Unity the ability to purchase a higher CCU, starting at $29 per month for 100 CCU, up to $128 per month for 10000 CCU (Atavism 2021).  Whereas Amazon GameLift offers an Auto-scaling feature meaning that you only pay for what you use, with prices ranging from $8.80 per month to $279.05 per month for spot instances, where your server fills an empty spot on a AWS server until they spot is needed and then it is closed, to $44.53 to $1,866.61 per month for on-demand instances (Amazon Web Services 2021).

  <b>Security</b>
  <p>To protect against hackers, developers can recode their login pages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) according to the OWASP Reverse Engineering and Code Modification Prevention Project best practices (Akamai 2019).  OWASP (2021) states that to prevent reverse engineering attacks requires the use of a commercial obfuscation tool to obfuscate string tables and methods, then run a de-obfuscating tool like IDA Pro and Hopper.  Games developers also need to utilise anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protections (Akamai 2019).  Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure was designed to be resistant to DDoS attacks and is supported by a DDoS mitigation system that automatically detects malicious traffic and then filters it out (Leung 2017).  Amazon GameLift includes a resource protection feature that prevent one player from creating multiple game session to use up all available resources, by allowing the Game Developer to set a resource creation limit policy which specifies the maximum number of game sessions one player can create within a set time limit (Leung 2017).  Amazon also recommends that Game Developers design their game servers to detect and filter out malicious traffic by declining any excessive requests that exceed server capacity by enforcing a maximum number of concurrent requests or at the Load Balancer, reroutes all client requests across all servers capable of handling the request (Leung 2017; NGINX n.d.).  Another method to prevent attacks is by utilising bot management solutions (Akamai 2019).  Bot management involves detecting bot activity, and then determining whether that bot exhibiting undesirable behaviour, and then identifying the sources of undesirable activity (Cloudflare 2021).  The last way to prevent attacks mentioned by Akamai (2021) is to used a Identity as a Service (IDaaS) provider to supply cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) through the use of multi-factor authentication (Cloudflare 2021).</p><br>

  <b>Competitors</b>
  One major competitor and one of my main influences for why I was considered creating this game in the first place is Bit Heroes, which is a dungeon-crawling MMORPG, based on old-school turn-based RPGs (Juppiomenz 2017).
